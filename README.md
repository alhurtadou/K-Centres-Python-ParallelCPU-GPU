# **Enhancing K-Centres Algorithm Efficiency in Python across Multi-Core and Many-Core Platforms**
>The programs are part of a shor paper presented to a 18CCC.
>
>The site shows different implementation in python using: multithreading libraries for CPU and differents python libraries for execute K-Centres in GPU.
>
>These programs was develop by Santiago Monroy.

## Python programs description

> ### Secuencial.ipynb: This notebook contains a sequential version of the k-centres algorithm. You can enhance this by optimizing the algorithm itself or using parallelization techniques.

> ### Evaluar_t_cpuParalelo.ipynb: Program that contains a multithreading version of K-Centres algorithm in Python.

> ### Evaluar_t_CUPY.ipynb: Program that contains a GPU parallel implementation of K-Centres algorithm using CUPY libaries.
	
> ### Evaluar_t_Numba.ipynb: Program that contains a GPU parallel implementation of K-Centres algorithm using Numba libaries .
	
> ### Evaluar_t_PyCUDA.ipynb: Program that contains a GPU parallel implementation of K-Centres algorithm using PyCUDA libaries.
